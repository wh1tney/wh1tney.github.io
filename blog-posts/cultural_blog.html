			<h2>The Tech Treadmill</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 8th, 2014</div>
			
			Tech moves fast. Very fast. <em>Extremely</em> fast.
			
			<br><br>
			
			It can often be a struggle to catch up. This struggle is compounded by a term I've heard referred to as <strong><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=magpie%20syndrome" title="Magpie syndrome definition">Magpie Syndrome</a></strong>, or the liking of shiny new things. Simply put, people always tend to seek out the new hotness. As is the case with other rapidly-growing industries, the <em>new hotness</em> in tech seems to get newer and hotter everyday.
			
			<br><br>
			
			There are new languages, frameworks, development tools, platforms, etc. being created all the time. This can make the tech industry feel like a treadmill without a stop button. As a new programmer, it can be confusing deciding which technologies to learn...especially when those technologies run the risk of being phased out in a matter of years. This is a problem because it can potentially turn great minds away from tech, for fear that knowledge gained may soon be obsolete. For many budding developers, there is a looming feeling of not being able to "keep up" with the industry and the skills the market demands.
			
			<br><br>
			
			So how do we quell this? The short answer is...we can't. But there are perhaps some ways to mitigate this and encourage those new to technology to see beyond the treadmill. We can start by leading with the right questions:
			
			<div class="note">
				<strike>What language should I learn?</strike>
				<br>What concepts should I understand?
				<br><br>
				<strike>Should I learn back-end or front-end web development?</strike>
				<br>How do current technologies shape the web from a high level perspective?
			</div>
			
			Et cetera. Core programming concepts, algorithms, and several focus areas are fairly language-agnostic, and hold fast during the constantly changing wave of new tech. There will always be the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" title="Apple - Swift Programming Language"> hot programming language</a> of the week, but if we can encourage the folks joining tech to focus on underlying concepts and high level knowledge, there might be a little less overwhelm from the constant speed of the tech treadmill.

			<h2>Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Monday June 2nd, 2014</div>

			<div class="note">"Gregorc's Mind Styles model provides an organized way to consider how the mind works." (<a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" title="Mind Styles - Anthony Gregorc">source</a>)</div>
			
			According to Anthony Gregorc's model, my perceptual quality is <em>concrete</em> while my ordering ability is <em>sequential</em>. This makes me a <strong>Concrete Sequential</strong> thinker.<br><br>
			
			Basically, I tend to think in algorithms and like structured environments where everyone uses logical reasoning. This is entirely true to my character.<br><br>
			
			Unfortunately, as the Gregorc thinking style website notes, this makes it quite difficult for me to work in groups. Though I like to think I am a good collaborator, this is certainly something I plan to focus on during my time at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" title="Dev Bootcamp">Dev Bootcamp</a>. Peer pairing is going to be critical for me, as I learn to work well with others on challenges and attempt to articulate my thoughts and intentions to another while coding.<br><br>
			
			So far, my greatest weakness during Phase 0 of DBC has been self discipline. I struggle to create a strict daily schedule for myself in an effort to get all of the work done in a timely manner. To rectify this, I have decided to leverage a few software tools to keep me on track: <a href="http://www.evernote.com" title="Evernote">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://calendar.sunrise.am" title="Sunrise Calendar">Sunrise</a>, and a <a href="http://www.tomighty.org/" title="Tomighty">Pomodoro</a> app. I am also learning how to <a href="http://blog.iqmatrix.com/how-to-mind-map" title="How to Mind Map for Beginners">mind map</a>.<br><br>
			
			See? I not only intend to learn programming at DBC, but I plan to gain productivity hacks!<br><br>
			
			By the end of this, I will be a ninja.

			<h2>Kia toa, Kia toa</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday May 18th, 2014</div>
				
				I am nervous.<br>I am excited.<br>I am nervous.<br><br>
				I know my life is about to change at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" title="Dev Bootcamp">Dev Bootcamp</a>, both personally and professionally. My nerves are calmed a bit when I realize there are so many people willing to go through this crazy experience with me.<br><br>
				So to my fellow cohorts, thank you.<br><br>
				
				The experience has been fairly enjoyable thus far...but it feels like I am holding my breath, anticipating the part where I get kicked in the brain:<br><br>
				
				<em>The late nights struggling through a tough problem.<br>
				Feeling less-than-confident during peer pairing.<br>
				Wondering if I am really cut out for this program.</em><br><br>
				
				These are very vulnerable feelings. But recent impressions of DBC have made me realize the importance of vulnerability in a program that will test us mentally, emotionally, and psychologically.<br><br>
				
				I look forward to being immersed in the DBC culture while striving to become a better programmer and a better person.
