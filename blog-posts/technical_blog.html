			<h2>Classy Food Trucks</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 15th, 2014</div>
			<div class="note">
			Where there's food, there's a real world model for Ruby classes.
			</div>
				<a href="http://offthegridsf.com/" title="offthegridsf.com">Off The Grid SF</a> is an experience that brings street food vendors and the communities they serve together in the city of San Francisco. Vendors prepare and sell food from full-service trucks, delighting foodies and wanderers alike with everything from kabobs to burritos to organic ice cream.
				<br><br>Let's examine the Off The Grid experience and model it using Ruby <strong>classes</strong>. 
				
				<br><br>
				We will start by modeling a portion of Off the Grid, a collection of several different food trucks (there are actually <a href="http://offthegridsf.com/vendors#food" title="Vendors-Food">over 150</a> OTG food vendors):
				
				<div class="parking-lot">
					<div class="truck">
						<ul>
							<li>
							Curry Up Now
							</li>
							<li>
							&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
							</li>
							$11
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="truck">	
						<ul>
							<li>
							KoJa Kitchen
							</li>
							<li>
							&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
							</li>
							<li>
							$8
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="truck">	
						<ul>
							<li>
							Garden Creamery
							</li>
							<li>
							&#9733;&#9733;
							</li>
							<li>
							$9
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>	
					<div class="truck">	
						<ul>
							<li>
							Kung Fu Tacos
							</li>
							<li>
							&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
							</li>
							<li>
							$10
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="truck">	
						<ul>
							<li>
							Lobsta Truck
							</li>
							<li>
							&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
							</li>
							<li>
							$13
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="truck">	
						<ul>
							<li>
								Me So Hungry
							</li>
							<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;
							</li>
							<li>
								$11
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>	
				</div>
				<br><br>
				What do you notice? Let's think about this. Though there are several different vendors, each with its own distinct <em>values</em> for name, average rating, and average price...information for each vendor is stored and presented with the exact same <em>structure</em>.
				<div class="parking-lot">
					<div class="truck" style="float:none; margin:auto;">
					<ul>
					<li>
						Truck name
					</li>
					<li>
					Avg Rating
					</li>
					Avg Price
					<li>
					</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				So how do we model this structure in code? We use a <strong>class</strong>. Let's stick with our example and create class Vendor.<br>
				<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass1.png" alt="Vendor class code snippet">
				
				Remember, it doesn't matter if the vendor sells hot dogs or enchiladas, some basic properties are shared by every single vendor. Let's add these shared properties, or <strong>instance variables</strong>, to our class.
				
				<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass2.png" alt="Instance variables code snippet">
				
				Now we can easily create multiple vendors with a specific name, rating, and price. When a new food truck vendor joins Off the Grid, we can use our Vendor class to create a new object and specify its properties.
				
				<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass3.png" alt="Sample Vendor object">

				 Simple. You see, a class is like a blueprint. Objects that share the same blueprint can be created from the same class. Let's look at the creation of more Vendor objects.
				 
				 <img class="code" src="images/vendorclass4.png" alt="Sample Vendor object">
				 
				 The properties that these objects have in common (prefixed with an <em>@</em> symbol, i.e. @name, @rating, and @price) are called <strong>instance variables</strong>. Note, properties are common between objects &ndash; not the <em>values</em> of those properties. Though the objects are created from the same class, instance variables store values specific to each object, e.g. Chicken and Waffles has a 5-star rating while Falafel Street has a 2-star rating. 
				 
				 <br><br>
				 Stay tuned for more Off the Grid madness. In Part 2 of this post, we will discuss how to use <strong>instance methods</strong> to manipulate instance variables.

			<h2>The Ruby Pretzel</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 8th, 2014</div>
				This week in JavaScript, I was introduced to this beast:
				
			<div class="note">array_of_strings = array.map(&:to_s)</div>
			
			At first, heads exploded. What the heck is that pretzel colon thingy? To understand this gibberish requires a basic understanding of the JavaScript method <strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html#method-i-map" title="RubyDocs">map</a></strong>.
			<div class="note">map { |item| block } â†’ new_ary</div>
			<div class="note">The builtin method <strong>map</strong> is an instance method for Ruby arrays and hashes. In this post, we will be referring to the method that operates on arrays.</div>
			
			An array object calls map, which says "hey, gimme a block of code and I will execute it on every element in this array." It iterates through each item in the array, executing the code in the block and storing the new value of the item in a brand new array (if we don't want to create a new array, but simply wish to modify the old one, we would use destructive method <strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html#method-i-map-21" title="RubyDocs">map!</a></strong> with <strong>!</strong> on the end).
						
			<br><br>
			So what about that cryptic code from earlier?
			
			<div class="note">array_of_strings = array.map(&:to_s)</div>
			
			I'm glad you asked. This accomplishes the exact same thing. It is simply shorthand provided by Ruby (thank you, Ruby) to run a block of code on every single item in an array. To better understand what is happening, let's consider what is being passed into map...the operator <strong>&</strong> and the symbol <strong>:to_s</strong>.
			
			<br><br>			
			The <strong>&</strong>, or <em>unary ampersand operator</em>, makes our code equivalent to the following:
			
			<div class="note">array_of_strings = array.map(&:to_s.to_proc)</div>
			
			Here we have the method <strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc" title="RubyDocs (to_proc)">to_proc</a></strong> being called on the symbol <strong>:to_s</strong>. This method returns a Proc object, which (for the brevity of this post) is just a block of Ruby code that performs specific operations. For example, the code `:to_s.to_proc` shown above returns <strong>a block of code that converts given input to a string</strong>. Our handy unary ampersand operator then says "great! now run this block of code on every item in the list." And it does.
			
			<br><br>
			Smells a lot like the regular map method, with a little syntactic sugar, huh? That's because it is. Please use and enjoy.

			<h2>JavaScript</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 1st, 2014</div>

			Why has JavaScript taken over the web? Here are a few things to consider.
			<ul>
				<li>It has a simple syntax, making it a fairly easy language to learn</li>
				<li>No plugins are required to be installed</li>
				<li>JS is more lightweight than Flash and Java</li>
				<li>Several libraries that add useful features to the language are available </li>
			</ul>

			Aside from being popular, JavaScript is a really great language. With it, we can do a number of things...
			<ul>
				<li>Make websites respond to user interaction</li>
				<li>Display pop up messages</li>
				<li>Organize and present data</li>
				<li>Extra browser functionality with addons</li>
				<li>...even build apps and games!</li>
			</ul>

			While popular and awesome, JavaScript also has limitations. If you are looking to do the following with JavaScript, look elsewhere:
			<ul>
				<li>Directly access files on a user's system</li>
				<li>Write directly to files on a server (without a little help)</li>
				<li>Access databases</li>
				<li>Close a window it did not open</li>
				<li>Access websites hosted on another domain</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday May 25th, 2014</div>

				A hard thing to understand. Let's make it easy.<br><br>Here are three balloons stacked in a grey bin.<br>The balloons have default positions of <em>static</em>.<br>These pretty balloons ain't moving.
					<div class="sandbox">
						<div class="box box1"></div>
						<div class="box box2"></div>
						<div class="box box3"></div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="note">CSS:<br>#green-balloon<br>{ position:static; }</div>
				
				Now let's make the position of the green balloon <em>absolute</em>.
					<div class="sandbox">
						<div class="box box1"></div>
						<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute;"></div>
						<div class="box box3" ></div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="note">CSS:<br>#green-balloon<br>{ position:absolute; }</div>
				
				Wait a minute! What just happened? We "pulled" the green balloon out of the flow. We can literally position it <em>absolutely</em> anywhere &#8211; even on top of or underneath other balloons in the bin.
					<div class="sandbox" style="float:left; margin:10% auto;">
						<div class="box box1"></div>
						<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute; top:20%; right:10%;"></div>
						<div class="box box3" ></div>
					</div>
					<div class="sandbox" style="float:right; margin:10% auto;">
						<div class="box box1"></div>
						<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute; top:50%; right:10%; z-index:-1;"></div>
						<div class="box box3" ></div>
					</div>
					<div class="sandbox">
						<div class="box box1"></div>
						<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute; bottom:0; left:5%;"></div>
						<div class="box box3" ></div>
					</div>

				<br><br>

				This brings us to the <em>relative</em> position. Guess which div on this page has been <em>relative</em> the entire time we've been playing with balloons?
					<div class="sandbox">
					</div>
					
					<div class="note"><br>#grey-bin<br>{ position:relative; }</div>

					That's right, the grey bin! The bin that is holding our balloons must have a position of <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em> for any of this balloon floating nonsense to work. Why? Because this "limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements" &#8211; in plain English, it forces our balloons to be contained within it. Otherwise, when we position our green balloon to be <em>absolute</em>, it would go flying to its closest<em> non-static</em> parent, which may be an unintended div in your webpage, or the page itself!

					<br><br><em>Fixed</em> positioning is a bit easier to explain. Check out the sidebar on this page with the image of my beautiful face. The position of this div is <em>fixed</em>, meaning it's stuck there and I will be staring back at you forever.
					
					<br><br>Go ahead, scroll. Yep...still here.

			<h2>Websites That I Dig</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday May 18th, 2014</div>

			<div>
				<a href="http://www.soundcloud.com" title="SoundCloud" target="_blank"><img class="logo" src="images/soundcloud.png" alt="SoundCloud"></a><br>
				I am on SoundCloud 78% of all waking hours. 86% of open browser tabs are new SoundCloud music discoveries.
				I even curate a <a href="http://www.thunderhustle.com" title="Click Here Right Now For Amazingly Dope Playlists Full of Magical Sounds!!!">music blog</a> of crazy good SoundCloud playlists.<br>
				But let's talk about design and UX.<br><br>
				I love the SoundCloud design. It could use moar orange.<br>
				But the layout (navigation) of the site is simple and I love simple UI.<br><br>
				I hate the SoundCloud user experience. Discovering music aint easy.<br>
				Each tab on the profile settings page annoyingly opens in a new window.<br>
				Logging out of a user account on one browser tab subsequently logs the user out of ALL OPEN TABS.<br>
				It makes me want to cry.<br>
				Does any of that make sense? No? OK, on to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wjoba" title="Pay No Attention to These Tweets" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.<br>
				
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com" title="Twitter" target="_blank"><img class="logo" src="images/twitter.png" alt="Twitter"></a>

					Who doesn't love The Twitter?<br><br>
					The website is aesthetically appealing, easy to navigate, and is starting to look like Facebook...<br>
					which is great for <a href="https://twitter.com/wjoba/status/468161930465529856" title="The Book of Faces" target="_blank">people who don't use Facebook.</a><br><br>
					The UX is great, by sheer design of the service.<br>
					You can only accomplish an average of 5 useful things when using Twitter, which makes for a dead simple user experience.<br><br>
					Also, infinite scroll, ftw. I still gotta figure out how that works. AJAX?
				
				<a href="http://www.quora.com" title="Quora" target="_blank"><img class="logo" src="images/quora.jpg" alt="Quora"></a>
				
					Quora. Because it is important to know <a href="http://www.quora.com/Life/How-is-chess-similar-to-life" title"Hint: They are both hard." target="_blank">how life is similar to a game of chess.</a><br><br>
					Quora is for asking and answering questions, both trivial and life-changing.<br>
					There are subtle things about the design and user experience that make this obvious, e.g.<br>
					when the site is launched, the cursor is already neatly placed in the search box like <a href="http://www.google.com" title="NSA. Just Kidding." target="_blank">Google.</a><br><br>
					Cool.<br><br>
					Again, simplicity. I swear by it. And this site definitely has it.<br>
					The design eliminates the unnecessary and makes it really easy to perform basic functions<br>
					such as asking a question, upvoting an answer, following a user, etc.<br>
					A bit strange, but I am grossly intrigued by the fact that this site has almost no color<br>
					in its design.<br><br>
					This site will forever remain my homepage. Until I decide to change it.<br>
