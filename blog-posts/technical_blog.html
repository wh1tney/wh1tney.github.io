				<h2>APIs</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday July 6th, 2014</div>
				API stands for <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface. But what the heck does that mean? This post will scratch the mysterious surface of web APIs and why they are useful.
				
				<div class="note">
					An application-programming interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application or Web tool. A software company releases its API to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service. (<a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/business-communications/how-to-leverage-an-api-for-conferencing1.htm" target="_blank" title="howstuffworks - what is an api?">source</a>)
				</div>
				OK enough with the formal definitions; what does this mean in the real world? Let's use Twitter as an example.
				<br><br>
				
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> is a web <strike>timesuck</strike> service that provides a lot of real-time information in the form of tweets. Twitter's database holds a wealth of information, including usernames, detailed information about users, follower counts, and tweet content. If you wish to build a brand new Twitter application, it would be non-trivial to <em>copy</em> and <em>store</em> all of this data &mdash; Twitter has <a href="https://about.twitter.com/company" target="_blank" title="About Twitter">over 255 million monthly active users</a>! I am sure you would prefer a way to access the data this service has already accumulated. Herein lies the power of a solid web API.
			<br><br>
			Twitter is one of the many web services that provides a <em>set of instructions</em> to access their data. These instructions can be abstracted into <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries" target="_blank" title="Twitter Libraries">any programming language</a>, from JavaScript to Perl. The fundamental set of instructions (regardless of language) <em>is</em> the API. Your only job as a developer is to follow these instructions, or <em>leverage the API</em>, within your code to properly access the data. Easy, right?
			
			<br><br>
			Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter" target="_blank" title="A Ruby interface to the Twitter API">Ruby interface to the Twitter API</a>. It contains a library of instructions to compose a tweet, access a user profile, etc. This, and other APIs, provide extremely powerful ways to leverage the functionality of existing web services and the data they provide.

				<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 29th, 2014</div>
					<img src="images/xkcd.png" alt="xkcd comic">
					<div class="note">
					SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia - SQL Injection">source</a>)
					</div>
					
					<h4>What is it?</h4>
					SQL injection is a common web hack, typically used to gain access to a backend database. It is made possible as a result of an improperly coded website that allows SQL statements to be inserted into input fields, querying the database itself.
					
					<div class="note">SQL Injection vulnerabilities provide the means for a hacker to communicate directly to the database. (<a href="https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection" target="_blank" title="Acunetix">source</a>)</div>
					
					For example, a hacker could generate a SQL query to retrieve all usernames and passwords in a database. When this query is inserted into an input field, such as a login field in a web application, it can be executed and the hacker could gain access to what should be secure information. 
					
					<h4>How can we prevent it?</h4>
					SQL injection can be prevented by properly <em>sanitizing</em> data input. This means that the input is made invulnerable before being sent with the SQL query to the database. Before the query is sent to the database, it should be validated in some way. The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-can-i-prevent-sql-injection-in-php" target="_blank" title="StackOverflow - How can I prevent SQL-injection in PHP?">most popular response on StackOverflow</a> for preventing an attack is the following:
					
					<div class="note">Use prepared statements and parameterized queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters.</div>

				<h2>Procs, Blocks, & Lambdas</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 22nd, 2014</div>
				Since we have already covered <a href="#week5a">classes in Ruby</a> and <a href="#week4">skimmed the surface of Procs</a>, it is time to discuss blocks, Procs, and lambdas in more depth. Get ready to engage.
				
				<h4>Blocks</h4>
				<div class="note">A Ruby block is just a bit of code that can be executed. (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/0/1" target="_blank" title="Codecademy Blocks">source</a>)</div>
				
				Blocks of code can be used in Ruby to perform actions on data. Often, you will see blocks passed to method calls in order to operate on the receiver of the message. For example, if I want to <em>print my name</em> 10 times, I can pass instructions to <em>print my name</em> as a <strong>block</strong> to the Integer method <strong>times</strong> like so:
				
				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">10.times { puts "Whitney" }</code>
				<br>
				
				The block of code between the curly braces gets executed 1, 2, 3, ... 10 times! Pretty self-explanatory. But what about passing data to the block? For this, let's use another example, that iterates through a list of sauces because...who doesn't like sauce?
				
				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">["Sriracha", "Tapatio", "Soy"].each do |sauce|<br>puts "#{sauce} may be the best sauce I've ever had."<br>end</code>
				<br>
				
 Forgive the indentation, but take a good look at this code. As we pass through the array, we funnel data &mdash; i.e. <em>sauce</em> &mdash; to our block, printing out our saucy delight at each pass. 
 
 <br><br>
 
 Because a block is not an object in Ruby, we need another way to <em>save</em> blocks of code to a variable. This is where Procs come in.
				
				<h4>Procs</h4>
				<div class="note">You can think of a proc as a "saved" block: just like you can give a bit of code a name and turn it into a method, you can name a block and turn it into a proc. (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/1/1" target="_blank" title="Codecademy Procs">source</a>)</div>
				
				A Proc is a Ruby class that can be used to create objects that are just like blocks. Why is this useful? Well, it allows us to save these block-like objects to named variables which means we can use them multiple times throughout our code. Let's use our previous example of printing my name because you know you want to.
				
				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">say_my_name = Proc.new { puts "Whitney" }</code>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">10.times(&say_my_name)</code>
				<br>
				
				As you can see, we created a new Proc object and gave it a block as an argument. Now we have a named block of instructions to pass around, and an easy way to make our code resemble a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQgd6MccwZc&feature=kp" target="_blank" title="Destiny's Child - Say My Name">Destiny's Child hit song</a>:
				
				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">say_my_name = Proc.new { puts "Whitney" }</code>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">10.times(&say_my_name)</code>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">5.times(&say_my_name)</code>
				<br>
				
				(Note: <strong>&amp;</strong> is used to convert the proc object into a block before it is passed to a method that expects a block.)

				<h4>Lambdas</h4>
				<div class="note">[With] the exception of a bit of syntax and a few behavioral quirks, lambdas are identical to procs. (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/2/1" target="_blank" title="Codecademy Blocks">source</a>)</div>
				
				Essentially, lambdas and Procs are somewhat interchangeable. Rewriting our example code using lambdas would look like the following:
				
				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">say_my_name = lambda { puts "Whitney" }</code>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">10.times(&say_my_name)</code>
				<br>
				
				Did you try running the code above? Well, you should have because you will notice that it fails! The reason it fails is due to a distinct difference between Procs and lambdas.
				
				<div class="note">[A] lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing. (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/2/3" target="_blank" title="Codecademy Lambdas">source</a>)</div>
				
				Running the code above throws an error because when we call the <strong>times</strong> method with a block of code, we are actually passing the current iteration (1-10) to that block. If we do not account for this argument in our lambda, it will raise an <em>ArgumentError</em> (which would not happen if we used a Proc object). Our lambda should catch this argument and look more like the following:

				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">say_my_name = lambda {|iteration| puts "Whitney"}</code>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">10.times(&say_my_name)</code>
				<br>
				
				Ah, that's better. But there is one more distinct difference between a Proc object and a lambda that we have not yet discussed.
				
				<div class="note">[When] a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method. (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/2/3" target="_blank" title="Codecademy Lambdas">source</a>)</div>

				Let's see this in action by quoting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_(1971_film)" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia - Shaft">Shaft</a> and using the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Proc.html#method-i-call" target="_blank" title="Ruby Docs - Proc#call">call</a> method with both Proc objects and lambdas.
				
				<br><br>
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">def shaft_proc<br>
				  bio = Proc.new {return "He's a bad mother&ndash;" }<br>
				  bio.call<br>
				  puts "Shut yo mouth!"<br>
				  end</code>
				<br>
				
				<code class="prettyprint linenums">def shaft_lambda<br>
				  bio = lambda {return "He's a bad mother&ndash;" }<br>
				  bio.call<br>
				  puts "Shut yo mouth!"<br>
				  end</code>
				<br>
				
				Try the code above and see if it prints what you expect. As you can see, when the Proc object returns, the rest of the method does not get executed (nearly leaving us with some obscene output). However, when the lambda returns, the method continues, politely telling us to shut our mouths. Neat.

				<h2>Classy Food Trucks (Part 2)</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Friday June 20th, 2014</div>
				
					Last week, we learned how to use <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>instance variables</strong> in Ruby by digging into the wonderful world of <a href="#week5">food trucks</a>. This time, we will be exploring the bits of code, or <em>instance methods</em>, that manipulate these instance variables.
					
					<br><br>
					
					Let's begin by revisiting our Off The Grid food vendors:
					
					<div class="parking-lot">
						<div class="truck">
							<ul>
								<li>
								Curry Up Now
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								$11
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								KoJa Kitchen
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$8
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								Garden Creamery
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$9
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>	
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								Kung Fu Tacos
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$10
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								Lobsta Truck
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$13
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
									Me So Hungry
								</li>
								<li>
									&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
									$11
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>	
					</div>
	
					We created a Ruby <strong>class</strong> to model the vendors.
					
					<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass2.png" alt="Instance variables code snippet">
					
					What if we want the vendors to actually <em>do</em> something, like report their average rating? We need a way to send a <strong>message</strong> to a vendor instance like "Hey! Tell us your average rating..." &ndash; to which the vendor would reply "My average rating is 4 stars." Good news, we can do this with <strong>instance methods</strong>!
					
					<br><br>
					
					Instance methods perform bits of logic and/or operate on instance variables within a given class. Let's jump right into an example with code:
					
					<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass5.png" alt="Instance method code snippet">
					
					We have a new instance method <em>report_rating</em>. What does this method do? Well, it does exactly what we just described...it prints a vendor's rating by accessing the instance variable <em>@rating</em>. That's it. Nobody said instance methods have to be complicated (although they certainly can be).
					
					<br><br>
					
					Now, every time we call this method on a vendor instance, the vendor examines its own rating and prints it out!
					
					<br><br>
					To conclude, classes contain instance variables that represent an object's attributes (e.g. @rating) and instance methods that can perform operations on those attributes (e.g. the report_rating method outputs the rating). Classes can also contain <strong>class variables</strong> and <strong>class methods</strong>, but we will save these topics for another blog post.

				<h2>Classy Food Trucks (Part 1)</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 15th, 2014</div>
				<div class="note">
				Where there's food, there's a real world model for Ruby classes.
				</div>
					<a href="http://offthegridsf.com/" target="_blank" title="offthegridsf.com">Off The Grid SF</a> is an experience that brings street food vendors and the communities they serve together in the city of San Francisco. Vendors prepare and sell food from full-service trucks, delighting foodies and wanderers alike with everything from kabobs to burritos to organic ice cream.
					<br><br>Let's examine the Off The Grid experience and model it using Ruby <strong>classes</strong>. 
					
					<br><br>
					We will start by modeling a portion of Off the Grid, a collection of several different food trucks (there are actually <a href="http://offthegridsf.com/vendors#food" target="_blank" title="Vendors-Food">over 150</a> OTG food vendors):
					
					<div class="parking-lot">
						<div class="truck">
							<ul>
								<li>
								Curry Up Now
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								$11
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								KoJa Kitchen
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$8
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								Garden Creamery
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$9
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>	
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								Kung Fu Tacos
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$10
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
								Lobsta Truck
								</li>
								<li>
								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
								$13
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="truck">	
							<ul>
								<li>
									Me So Hungry
								</li>
								<li>
									&#9733;&#9733;
								</li>
								<li>
									$11
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>	
					</div>
					<br><br>
					What do you notice? Let's think about this. Though there are several different vendors, each with its own distinct <em>values</em> for name, average rating, and average price...information for each vendor is stored and presented with the exact same <em>structure</em>.
					<div class="parking-lot">
						<div class="truck" style="float:none; margin:auto;">
						<ul>
						<li>
							Truck name
						</li>
						<li>
						Avg Rating
						</li>
						Avg Price
						<li>
						</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					So how do we model this structure in code? We use a <strong>class</strong>. Let's stick with our example and create class Vendor.<br>
					<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass1.png" alt="Vendor class code snippet">
					
					Remember, it doesn't matter if the vendor sells hot dogs or enchiladas, some basic properties are shared by every single vendor. Let's add these shared properties, or <strong>instance variables</strong>, to our class.
					
					<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass2.png" alt="Instance variables code snippet">
					
					Now we can easily create multiple vendors with a specific name, rating, and price. When a new food truck vendor joins Off the Grid, we can use our Vendor class to create a new object and specify its properties.
					
					<img class="code" src="images/vendorclass3.png" alt="Sample Vendor object">
	
					 Simple. You see, a class is like a blueprint. Objects that share the same blueprint can be created from the same class. Let's look at the creation of more Vendor objects.
					 
					 <img class="code" src="images/vendorclass4.png" alt="Sample Vendor object">
					 
					 The properties that these objects have in common (prefixed with an <em>@</em> symbol, i.e. @name, @rating, and @price) are called <strong>instance variables</strong>. Note, properties are common between objects &ndash; not the <em>values</em> of those properties. Though the objects are created from the same class, instance variables store values specific to each object, e.g. Chicken and Waffles has a 5-star rating while Falafel Street has a 2-star rating. 
					 
					 <br><br>
					 Stay tuned for more Off the Grid madness. In Part 2 of this post, I will discuss how to use <strong>instance methods</strong> to manipulate instance variables.

				<h2>The Ruby Pretzel</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 8th, 2014</div>
					This week in JavaScript, I was introduced to this beast:
					
				<div class="note">array_of_strings = array.map(&:to_s)</div>
				
				At first, heads exploded. What the heck is that pretzel colon thingy? To understand this gibberish requires a basic understanding of the JavaScript method <strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html#method-i-map" target="_blank" title="RubyDocs">map</a></strong>.
				<div class="note">map { |item| block } → new_ary</div>
				<div class="note">The builtin method <strong>map</strong> is an instance method for Ruby arrays and hashes. In this post, we will be referring to the method that operates on arrays.</div>
				
				An array object calls map, which says "hey, gimme a block of code and I will execute it on every element in this array." It iterates through each item in the array, executing the code in the block and storing the new value of the item in a brand new array (if we don't want to create a new array, but simply wish to modify the old one, we would use destructive method <strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html#method-i-map-21" target="_blank" title="RubyDocs">map!</a></strong> with <strong>!</strong> on the end).
							
				<br><br>
				So what about that cryptic code from earlier?
				
				<div class="note">array_of_strings = array.map(&:to_s)</div>
				
				I'm glad you asked. This accomplishes the exact same thing. It is simply shorthand provided by Ruby (thank you, Ruby) to run a block of code on every single item in an array. To better understand what is happening, let's consider what is being passed into map...the operator <strong>&</strong> and the symbol <strong>:to_s</strong>.
				
				<br><br>			
				The <strong>&</strong>, or <em>unary ampersand operator</em>, makes our code equivalent to the following:
				
				<div class="note">array_of_strings = array.map(&:to_s.to_proc)</div>
				
				Here we have the method <strong><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc" target="_blank" title="RubyDocs (to_proc)">to_proc</a></strong> being called on the symbol <strong>:to_s</strong>. This method returns a Proc object, which (for the brevity of this post) is just a block of Ruby code that performs specific operations. For example, the code `:to_s.to_proc` shown above returns <strong>a block of code that converts given input to a string</strong>. Our handy unary ampersand operator then says "great! now run this block of code on every item in the list." And it does.
				
				<br><br>
				Smells a lot like the regular map method, with a little syntactic sugar, huh? That's because it is. Please use and enjoy.
				
				<br><br>
				Refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217088/what-does-mapname-mean-in-ruby" target="_blank" title="StackOverflow">this post</a> for more information.

					<li>Several libraries that add useful features to the language are available </li>
				</ul>
	
				Aside from being popular, JavaScript is a really great language. With it, we can do a number of things...
				<ul>
					<li>Make websites respond to user interaction</li>
					<li>Display pop up messages</li>
					<li>Organize and present data</li>
					<li>Extra browser functionality with addons</li>
					<li>...even build apps and games!</li>
				</ul>
	
				While popular and awesome, JavaScript also has limitations. If you are looking to do the following with JavaScript, look elsewhere:
				<ul>
					<li>Directly access files on a user's system</li>
					<li>Write directly to files on a server (without a little help)</li>
					<li>Access databases</li>
					<li>Close a window it did not open</li>
					<li>Access websites hosted on another domain</li>
				</ul>
				
				Now, go forth and learn it.

				<h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday May 25th, 2014</div>
	
					A hard thing to understand. Let's make it easy.<br><br>Here are three balloons stacked in a grey bin.<br>The balloons have default positions of <em>static</em>.<br>These pretty balloons ain't moving.
						<div class="sandbox">
							<div class="box box1"></div>
							<div class="box box2"></div>
							<div class="box box3"></div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="note">CSS:<br>#green-balloon<br>{ position:static; }</div>
					
					Now let's make the position of the green balloon <em>absolute</em>.
						<div class="sandbox">
							<div class="box box1"></div>
							<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute;"></div>
							<div class="box box3" ></div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="note">CSS:<br>#green-balloon<br>{ position:absolute; }</div>
					
					Wait a minute! What just happened? We "pulled" the green balloon out of the flow. We can literally position it <em>absolutely</em> anywhere &#8211; even on top of or underneath other balloons in the bin.
						<div class="sandbox" style="float:left; margin:10% auto;">
							<div class="box box1"></div>
							<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute; top:20%; right:10%;"></div>
							<div class="box box3" ></div>
						</div>
						<div class="sandbox" style="float:right; margin:10% auto;">
							<div class="box box1"></div>
							<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute; top:50%; right:10%; z-index:-1;"></div>
							<div class="box box3" ></div>
						</div>
						<div class="sandbox">
							<div class="box box1"></div>
							<div class="box box2" style="position:absolute; bottom:0; left:5%;"></div>
							<div class="box box3" ></div>
						</div>
	
					<br><br>
	
					This brings us to the <em>relative</em> position. Guess which div on this page has been <em>relative</em> the entire time we've been playing with balloons?
						<div class="sandbox">
						</div>
						
						<div class="note"><br>#grey-bin<br>{ position:relative; }</div>
	
						That's right, the grey bin! The bin that is holding our balloons must have a position of <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em> for any of this balloon floating nonsense to work. Why? Because this "limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements" &#8211; in plain English, it forces our balloons to be contained within it. Otherwise, when we position our green balloon to be <em>absolute</em>, it would go flying to its closest<em> non-static</em> parent, which may be an unintended div in your webpage, or the page itself!
	
						<br><br><em>Fixed</em> positioning is a bit easier to explain. Check out the sidebar on this page containing links to my profiles on the web. The position of this div is <em>fixed</em>, meaning it is stuck there and will be staring back at you forever.
						
						<br><br>Go ahead, scroll. Yep...still there.

				<h2>Websites That I Dig</h2>
				<div class="date">Posted Sunday May 18th, 2014</div>
	
				<div>
					<a href="http://www.soundcloud.com" title="SoundCloud" target="_blank"><img class="logo" src="images/soundcloud.png" alt="SoundCloud"></a><br>
					I am on SoundCloud 78% of all waking hours. 86% of open browser tabs are new SoundCloud music discoveries.
					I even curate a <a href="http://www.thunderhustle.com" target="_blank" title="Click Here Right Now For Amazing Playlists Full of Magical Sounds!!!">music blog</a> of crazy good SoundCloud playlists.<br>
					But let's talk about design and UX.<br><br>
					I love the SoundCloud design. It could use moar orange.<br>
					But the layout (navigation) of the site is simple and I love simple UI.<br><br>
					I hate the SoundCloud user experience. Discovering music aint easy.<br>
					Each tab on the profile settings page annoyingly opens in a new window.<br>
					Logging out of a user account on one browser tab subsequently logs the user out of ALL OPEN TABS.<br>
					It makes me want to cry.<br>
					Does any of that make sense? No? OK, on to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wjoba" target="_blank" title="Pay No Attention to These Tweets">Twitter</a>.<br>
					
					<a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank" title="Twitter"><img class="logo" src="images/twitter.png" alt="Twitter"></a>
	
						Who doesn't love The Twitter?<br><br>
						The website is aesthetically appealing, easy to navigate, and is starting to look like Facebook...<br>
						which is great for <a href="https://twitter.com/wjoba/status/468161930465529856" target="_blank" title="The Book of Faces">people who don't use Facebook.</a><br><br>
						The UX is great, by sheer design of the service.<br>
						You can only accomplish an average of 5 useful things when using Twitter, which makes for a dead simple user experience.<br><br>
						Also, infinite scroll, ftw. I still gotta figure out how that works. AJAX?
					
					<a href="http://www.quora.com" target="_blank" title="Quora"><img class="logo" src="images/quora.jpg" alt="Quora"></a>
					
						Quora. Because it is important to know <a href="http://www.quora.com/Life/How-is-chess-similar-to-life" target="_blank" title"Hint: They are both hard.">how life is similar to a game of chess.</a><br><br>
						Quora is for asking and answering questions, both trivial and life-changing.<br>
						There are subtle things about the design and user experience that make this obvious, e.g.<br>
						when the site is launched, the cursor is already neatly placed in the search box like <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="NSA. Just Kidding.">Google.</a><br><br>
						Cool.<br><br>
						Again, simplicity. I swear by it. And this site definitely has it.<br>
						The design eliminates the unnecessary and makes it really easy to perform basic functions<br>
						such as asking a question, upvoting an answer, following a user, etc.<br>
						A bit strange, but I am grossly intrigued by the fact that this site has almost no color<br>
						in its design.<br><br>
						This site will forever remain my homepage. And daily timesuck.<br>
