			<h2>Values</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Sunday June 29th, 2014</div>
			Autonomy is one of my most appreciated values. The ability to think and operate independently in most areas of my life has required a great deal of discipline and planning. The reward has been a sense of freedom in knowing that I am 100% responsible for how I live, work, create, and relate to the people and things that shape my universe.

<div class="note">
	Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.
	</div>

Making courageous decisions is the first step to enabling full autonomy. It requires a significant amount of courage to undertake seemingly arduous tasks. Having to muster the courage to face debt, unemployment, uncertainty, and hardship has allowed me to become the individual I am today: an individual with less fear than I had yesterday.

I express full autonomy and courage every single day. These values quell the reality of stereotype threat, and the assumption that I will not be able to handle a particular situation or circumstance. Meditation and mindfulness further strengthen my resolve; I intend to faithfully practice both during the 9 weeks at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">DevBootcamp</a>.

			<h2>Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
			<div class="date">Posted Monday June 2nd, 2014</div>

			<div class="quote">"Gregorc's Mind Styles model provides an organized way to consider how the mind works." (<a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" title="Mind Styles - Anthony Gregorc">source</a>)</div>

			According to Anthony Gregorc's model, my perceptual quality is <em>concrete</em> while my ordering ability is <em>sequential</em>. This makes me a <strong>Concrete Sequential</strong> thinker.<br><br>

			Basically, I tend to think in algorithms and like structured environments where everyone uses logical reasoning. This is entirely true to my character.<br><br>

			Unfortunately, as the Gregorc thinking style website notes, this makes it quite difficult for me to work in groups. Though I like to think I am a good collaborator, this is certainly something I plan to focus on during my time at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" title="Dev Bootcamp">Dev Bootcamp</a>. Peer pairing is going to be critical for me, as I learn to work well with others on challenges and attempt to articulate my thoughts and intentions to another while coding.<br><br>

			So far, my greatest weakness during Phase 0 of DBC has been self discipline. I struggle to create a strict daily schedule for myself in an effort to get all of the work done in a timely manner. To rectify this, I have decided to leverage a few software tools to keep me on track: <a href="http://www.evernote.com" title="Evernote">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://calendar.sunrise.am" title="Sunrise Calendar">Sunrise</a>, and a <a href="http://www.tomighty.org/" title="Tomighty">Pomodoro</a> app. I am also learning how to <a href="http://blog.iqmatrix.com/how-to-mind-map" title="How to Mind Map for Beginners">mind map</a>.<br><br>

			See? I not only intend to learn programming at DBC, but I plan to gain productivity hacks!<br><br>

			By the end of this, I will be a ninja.

			<h2>Kia toa, Kia toa</h2>

				I am nervous.<br>I am excited.<br>I am nervous.<br><br>
				I know my life is about to change at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" title="Dev Bootcamp">Dev Bootcamp</a>, both personally and professionally. My nerves are calmed a bit when I realize there are so many people willing to go through this crazy experience with me.<br><br>
				So to my fellow cohorts, thank you.<br><br>

				The experience has been fairly enjoyable thus far...but it feels like I am holding my breath, anticipating the part where I get kicked in the brain:<br><br>

				<em>The late nights struggling through a tough problem.<br>
				Feeling less-than-confident during peer pairing.<br>
				Wondering if I am really cut out for this program.</em><br><br>

				These are very vulnerable feelings. But recent impressions of DBC have made me realize the importance of vulnerability in a program that will test us mentally, emotionally, and psychologically.<br><br>

				I look forward to being immersed in the DBC culture while striving to become a better programmer and a better person.
