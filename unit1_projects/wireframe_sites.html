		<p><em>What problem is the web page solving?</em><br><br> 
		SoundCloud is a platform for sharing and discovering the world's sounds.<br><br>
		<em>What visual challenges are there?</em><br><br>
		Visually, the site is very content focused. This creates the visual challenge of<br> 
		vast information presentation; how will the site be organized in such a way that<br>
		content does not <strong>look</strong> and <strong>feel</strong> cluttered? Is it obvious to the user which actions<br>
		(like, repost, comment) are possible and encouraged through design?

		<p><em>What problem is the web page solving?</em><br><br> 
		Twitter is a channel for text and media, allowing users to broadcast to any audience.<br>
		It solves the problem of presenting these broadcasts in near-real time within a structured,<br>
		readable stream focused on user content.<br><br>
		<em>What visual challenges are there?</em><br><br>
		Visual challenges exist because some users perform specific actions outside<br>
		of simply reading their Twitter stream. Placement of the buttons, text fields, etc.<br>
		should be obvious, yet unobtrusive creating a visual challenge for the site's layout.

		<a href="http://www.quora.com" title="Quora"><h2>Quora</h2></a>
		<p><em>What problem is the web page solving?</em><br><br> 
		Quora is a site dedicated to asking and answering questions about any imaginable topic.<br>
		It solves the problem of quick and efficient <em>community-based learning</em>, allowing anyone to ask or answer a question about <strong>anything.</strong><br><br>
		<em>What visual challenges are there?</em><br><br>
		The visual challenge with this site is being able to present enough of each answer to garner<br>
		the interest and attention of users browsing the site, while still visually presenting enough<br>
		content (questions and answers) to demonstrate the utility of the site itself.
